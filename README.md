## Overview
This project is to convert a photoshop document (PSD) into a functional HTML static single-page site.
I will be using GIMP to pull the assets.
I will be using Figma for the wireframes. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- View parallax scrolling in hero
- View sticky nav
- Switch between images in image carousel
- Switch between images for mountain views via Mountain Buttons
- Access accessibility such as screen readers and tab through.

## My process
I began by pulling the PSD files into GIMP and pulling the assets - images, icons, colors, etc. I could not get the font information as it wasn't included in the original PSD. After gathering assets, I started working on the wireframes and layout.
Once got my hi-fi wireframe set up, I started working on coding the project out to give me an idea of what this would be like for a developer to build. This would tell me which tools would work best for the project and what the challenges of coding it will look like. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - Figma
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org/) - GIMP

### What I learned

So far this has been a very interesting project. There's a few gotchas in here when it comes to layering images, positioning images and the getting them to scroll under one another for the parallax effect. 


### Continued development

This is an ongoing project and will continue to come together as I pull branches to work on bits here and there. Anyone is welcome to add to this project as it's mainly for the fun of learning. There's a link to the Figma files under the links section of this Readme. The current wireframes are for desktop which will also progress as I add wireframes for the mobile view. I am also still adding and updating accessibility as I go along.
