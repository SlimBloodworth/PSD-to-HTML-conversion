## Overview
This project is to convert a photoshop document (PSD) into a functional HTML static single-page site.
I will be using GIMP to pull the assets.
I will be using Figma for the wireframes. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- View parallax scrolling in hero
- View sticky nav
- Switch between images in image carousel
- Switch between images for mountain views via Mountain Buttons
- Access accessibility such as screen readers and tab through.

## My process
I began by pulling the PSD files into GIMP and pulling the assets - images, icons, colors, etc. I could not get the font information as it wasn't included in the original PSD. After gathering assets, I started working on the wireframes and layout.
Once got my hi-fi wireframe set up, I started working on coding the project out to give me an idea of what this would be like for a developer to build. This would tell me which tools would work best for the project and what the challenges of coding it will look like. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - Figma
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org/) - GIMP



### What I learned

So far this has been a very interesting project. There's a few gotchas in here when it comes to layering images, positioning images and the getting them to scroll under one another for the parallax effect. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

This is an ongoing project and will continue to come together as I pull branches to work on bits here and there. Anyone is welcome to add to this project as it's mainly for the fun of learning. There's a link to the Figma files under the links section of this Readme. The current wireframes are for desktop which will also progress as I add wireframes for the mobile view. I am also still adding and updating accessibility as I go along.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
